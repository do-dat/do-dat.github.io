As a tutorial, it is assumed that in the figure,

- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C(s)&space;=&space;2/(s&plus;4))
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_n(s)&space;=&space;5/(s-2))
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P(s)&space;=&space;\beta_0/(s&plus;\alpha_0)), where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4\leq\beta_0\leq&space;10,\:-10\leq\alpha_0\leq&space;10).

### Setup

---

The following code returns a structure variable `sysEnv` that contains the information about the system environment that will be used later in designing the DOB.

```
C = tf(2, [1, 4]);
P_n = tf(5, [1, -2]);

N = {[4, 10]};
D = {1, [-10, 10]};

sysEnv = setup_sys(N, D, P_n, C)
```

The field `nominalStab` is 1 since the nominal closed-loop system is stable and the field `minPhase` is also 1 since a given set of uncertain plants does not contain any non-minimum phase systems (In fact, there is no zero dynamics.).

### Design of Q-filter

---

The following code returns a transfer function model ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q(s;1)) `Qcanon` with a constant numerator and the relative degree `n` that robustly stabilizes the fast dynamics of the closed-loop system.

```
Qcanon = gen_Qcanon(sysEnv, n)
```

If you want to try to use your own ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q(s;1)) `udQcanon`, the following code informs you if the fast dynamics of the closed-loop system with `udQcanon` is robustly stable or not.

```
isFastDynamicsStable(sysEnv, udQcanon)
```

Finally, the following code returns the supremum ![equation] tau star, `supTau` such that for all , the closed-loop system with the DOB designed under Q(s;1) `Qcanon` is robustly stable.

```
supTau = get_supTau(sysEnv, Qcanon, 'exact')
supTau = get_supTau(sysEnv, Qcanon, 'approx', 10)
```
