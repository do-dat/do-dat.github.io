As a tutorial, it is assumed that in the figure,

- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C(s)&space;=&space;2/(s&plus;4)),
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_n(s)&space;=&space;5/(s-2)),
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P(s)&space;=&space;\beta_0/(s&plus;\alpha_0)), where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4\leq\beta_0\leq&space;10,\:-10\leq\alpha_0\leq&space;10).

### Setup

---

The following code returns a structure variable `sysEnv` that contains the information about the system environment that will be used later in designing the DOB.

```
C = tf(2, [1, 4]);
P_n = tf(5, [1, -2]);

N = {[4, 10]};
D = {1, [-10, 10]};

sysEnv = setup_sys(N, D, P_n, C)
```
```
C = tf(1, [1, 1]);
P_n = tf(1, [1, 2, 1]);
N = {[1, 4]};
D = {[1, 10], [2, 3], 1};
sysEnv = setup_sys(N, D, P_n, C);
Qcanon = gen_Qcanon(sysEnv, 2);
tau_star = get_supTau(sysEnv, Qcanon, 'exact');

Qcanon =
1/(s^2+s+1)
tau_star = 
0.122377904565862
```
The field `nominalStab` is 1 since the nominal closed-loop system is stable and the field `minPhase` is also 1 since a given set of uncertain plants does not contain any non-minimum phase systems (In fact, there is no zero dynamics.).

### Design of Q-filter

---

The following code returns a transfer function model ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q(s;1)) `Qcanon` with a constant numerator and the relative degree 3 that robustly stabilizes the fast dynamics of the closed-loop system.

```
Qcanon = gen_Qcanon(sysEnv, 3)
```

If you want to try to use your own ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q(s;1)=1/(s&plus;1)), the following code informs you if the fast dynamics of the closed-loop system is robustly stable or not.

```
isFastDynamicsStable(sysEnv, tf(1, [1, 1]))
```

Finally, the following code returns the supremum ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\tau^*), `supTau` such that for all ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0<\tau<\tau^*), the closed-loop system with the DOB designed under `Qcanon` is robustly stable. Here, Symbolic Math Toolbox is required for the option `'exact'` and `10` means the resolution of the `'approximate'` search method.


```
supTau = get_supTau(sysEnv, Qcanon, 'exact')
supTau = get_supTau(sysEnv, Qcanon, 'approx', 10)
```

In conclusion, DO-DAT suggests you to use the Q-filter for the robust stability of the closed-loop system as follows.

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q(s;\tau)&space;=&space;\frac{0.5}{(\tau&space;s)^3&plus;2(\tau&space;s)^2&plus;&space;(\tau&space;s)&space;&plus;&space;0.5}) , for any ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0<\tau<0.0232).
