### History

[The Lab](https://post.cdsl.kr/) was founded in 1989 by Prof. Jin Heon Seo with the name “Automatic Control Lab”. The name was changed in 1995 to “Optimal Robust Control Lab” and finally to “Control and Dynamic Systems Lab” in 2006. Prof. Hyungbo Shim joined the Lab in 2003. The Lab has produced more than 100 of Ph.D’s and Master’s who are playing active roles currently in their respective fields of interests.

### Research Interest

Our research interest is about “control theory”. Two key words that represent our research simply well might be “control” and “dynamics”. (See also the Wikipedia’s definition of “control theory”, click here. Introduction of the IEEE Control System Society and its report named “The impact of control technology (2nd ed.)” might be helpful to understand the “control”.
