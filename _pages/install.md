1. Remove any old version of DO-DAT.

2. Unzip the downloaded DO-DAT.zip file.

3. Add the following directories to your MATLAB path.
```
./DO_DAT/functions
./DO_DAT/operators
```
__`./DO_DAT/functions` directory contains main functions of DO-DAT__.

`./DO_DAT/operators` directory includes several basic operators used in the main functions (You don't need to look into this folder!).

4. To test your installation, run the example code `/DO_DAT/functions/main.m`.

DO-DAT is mainly developed on a Windows machine using MATLAB 2018b and has not been tested on other platforms or earlier versions of MATLAB.
