1. Remove any old version of DO-DAT.

2. Unzip the downloaded DO-DAT.zip file.

3. Add the following directories to your MATLAB path.

  ```
  ./DO_DAT/functions
  ./DO_DAT/operators
  ```

  - `./DO_DAT/functions` directory contains __main functions of DO-DAT__.

  - `./DO_DAT/operators` directory includes several basic operators used in the main functions (You don't need to look into this directory!).

4. Test your installation through running the example code `/DO_DAT/functions/main.m`.

DO-DAT is mainly developed on a Windows machine using MATLAB 2018b and has not been tested on other platforms or earlier versions of MATLAB.
