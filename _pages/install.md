1. Remove any old version of DO-DAT.

2. Unzip the downloaded DO-DAT.zip file.

3. Add the following directories to your MATLAB path.

  ```
  ./DO_DAT/functions
  ./DO_DAT/operators
  ```

  - `./DO_DAT/functions` directory contains __main functions__ of DO-DAT.

  - `./DO_DAT/operators` directory includes several basic operators used in the main functions (You don't need to look into this directory!).

To test your installation, run the example code `/DO_DAT/functions/main.m`.

DO-DAT is mainly developed on a __Windows__ machine using __MATLAB 2018b__ and has not been tested on other platforms or earlier versions of MATLAB.
If you have any problems including version issues, please [contact](https://do-dat.github.io/contact/).
