I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University, Korea in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Since 2021, I have been at Seoul National University where I am currently a Ph.D. candidate. I am interested in data-driven control and robust control techniques including disturbance observer.
