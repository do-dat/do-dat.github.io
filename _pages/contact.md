I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea in 2019. Since 2019, I have been at Seoul National University where I am currently a M.S. candidate in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am interested in robust control techniques, including disturbance observer.

All suggestions, comments, and bug reports on DO-DAT are very welcome.
