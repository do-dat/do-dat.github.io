DO-DAT is developed mainly based on the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9303855) (to be presented at 2020 CDC).
You can see the detailed and mathematical underlying algorithm of DO-DAT in the paper.

In addition, our lab [CDSL](https://do-dat.github.io/cdsl/) has been conducting various studies on the disturbance observer for a long time
and you can find related results at the following [link](http://post.cdsl.kr/archives/69).
