DO-DAT is developed mainly based on the [paper](https://github.com/do-dat/do-dat.github.io/raw/master/docs/CDC20_Hamin_Chang.pdf).
You can see DO-DAT's mathematical and detailed underlying algorithm in the paper.

In addition, our lab [CDSL](https://do-dat.github.io/cdsl/) has been conducting various studies on the disturbance observer for a long time
and you can find related results at the following [link](http://post.cdsl.kr/archives/69).
